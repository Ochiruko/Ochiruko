I love learning but can't really get anything done. I'm (kinda sorta)
familiar with Python, Haskell, Java, C, Vimscript, Rust, BASH, and Lua (ranked from 
most to least). Writing GUI interfaces drives me a little nuts, but I love thinking 
up algorithms. I also enjoy explaining them, although the people around me don't.

"To learn and not do is to not learn. To know and not do is to not know."
\-\-paraphrase of a quote most likely said by someone, somewhere, some time.

UPDATE: When I'm procrastinating schoolwork, I'm actually fairly decent at getting
things done.
