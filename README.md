Hello, I love learning but can't do. Python, Java, Haskell, C, Vimscript, Rust,
BASH, Lua... are all languages that I am (only) kinda sorta familiar with (ranked
from most familiar to least).
I hate doing creative GUI development with a passion, and love thinking up pretty
algorithms. I also enjoy explaining them, although the people around me don't.
