Hello, I love learning but can't do. Haskell, Python, Java, C, BASH, vimscript...
are all languages that I am (only) kinda sorta familiar with.
I hate doing creative GUI development with a passion, and love thinking up pretty
algorithms. I also love explaining them, although the people around me don't.
