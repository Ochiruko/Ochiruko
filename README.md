Hi! I'm Dylan, a high school student who enjoys grinding out a project or two (or
project euler solution) when I have time and am not in a reading or (far less frequently)
gaming phase. I'm familiar with Python, Haskell, Java, Vimscript, Rust, BASH, Lua, and C (ranked from 
most to least). Designing GUI interfaces drives me a little nuts, but I love thinking 
up algorithms. I also enjoy explaining them, although the people around me don't.

"To learn and not do is to not learn. To know and not do is to not know."
\-\-paraphrase of a quote most likely said by someone, somewhere, some time.

UPDATE: When I'm procrastinating schoolwork, I'm actually fairly decent at getting
work done in projects.
