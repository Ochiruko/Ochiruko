Hi! I'm Dylan, a college freshman passionate about collaborative software development. I'm proficient in Haskell, Rust, Python, Go, Java, and C, and have experience using Git for version control. Currently, I'm leading a four-person project to develop a generic settings app for DE-less Linux, focusing on modularity and extensibility.

I'm actively seeking an internship or junior software engineering role to expand my skills and contribute to impactful projects. While I still have plenty to learn, I bring a strong work ethic, a love of problem-solving, and a deep curiosity for new challenges. Programming is both my passion and a career path I'm eager to pursue.

If you're looking for a motivated learner who thrives in collaborative environments, I'd be thrilled to connect! You can reach me at dylansommer96@gmail.com.
